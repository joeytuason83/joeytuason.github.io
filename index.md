## Data Mining, Machine Learning and AI Models

[Topic Modelling On News Weblinks Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA Model)](https://github.com/joeytuason83/joeytuason.github.io/blob/0787bcb38665ace91dae958de081eb568b8b2338/Machine%20Learning/LDA%20Topic%20Modelling%20on%20News%20Pages_FINAL.ipynb)

Given a collection of news website article links, can we be able to identify topics which will aptly describe these beyond their given category? In this project we explore unsupervised learning in NLP which would help us determine the underlying clusters using Topic Modelling via the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model.

We performed data cleaning, processing, EDA (using Word Cloud, Word Frequency) and executed the model and found desirable results. This was submitted as the final requirement of the Data Mining class.

## Other Scripts and Automations Done (Python, R)

[Data Reading](https://github.com/joeytuason83/joeytuason83.github.io/blob/9d899ae8acb82b75a68ed409f8ae00214ec28546/Scripts/Loading%20Datasets%20(Data%20Mining%20Week%202).ipynb)

Good reference for beginners learning to injest data into Jupyter notebook. This was the first exercise in Data Mining class week 2. Added new codes learned after submission (eg. import warnings). 
The following were done:
1. read_csv: commonly used to load csv files but was used but not on csv files; used additional lines of code to consider header and row index
2. read_xlsx: data read had nulls and actual table started at row 6
3. read_json
4. reading zip formatted file & save to excel: only requires read_csv just add compression='gzip' (no need to extract file inside)
